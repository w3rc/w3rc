into production — not demos, things that actually run under load with real
users who aren't developers.

**What I build:**
- AI-powered content and automation platforms (OpenAI, Claude, Whisper)
- Full stack web apps (React, Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL)
- Desktop tools (Electron), pipelines, scheduled workers, Telegram bots
- Anything that needs an LLM connected to a real backend

**Current stack:** React · Node.js · TypeScript · PostgreSQL · Express · Whisper API · OpenAI API · Claude API · Vite · AWS
